# Pixelart Rotation In Godot

Using Godot 3.5.1, 04/2023

As you might know Godot **draws** in HD the pixelart (using 2D in window project properties) and then **rotate**, which creates not pixelart style, so what we need is to rotate first and the draw (like if you do by hand in Aseprite, rotate there, export and then view in Godot). 

To do that I added an option to set the rotation pivot point in pixels, so you can view the pixel point you want for instance in Aseprite.

Then understand that you need enough space to rotate the image pixels and not be clipped, so be sure the image area where the pixelart is also covers all the rotated pixels, attached images as example.

NOTE 1 : I use 1.1 in the pixelation to make the minimum pixelart.
